# Machine-Learning-Final-Project
  This is the final project in the course: "Machine Learning, Data Science and Deep Learning with Python".


About the project:

    1. Subject: Predict whether a mammogram mass is benign or malignant
    2. Dataset: This data contains 961 instances of masses detected in mammograms
    3. Apply several different supervised machine learning techniques to this data set, 
      and see which one yields the highest accuracy as measured with K-Fold cross validation (K=10). Apply:
      
      * Decision tree
      * Random forest
      * KNN
      * Naive Bayes
      * SVM
      * Logistic Regression
      * A neural network using Keras.
